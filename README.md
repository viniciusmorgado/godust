# Godust

Godust is a CLI tool that generates [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) project templates in Rust, specifically using the godot-rust library (GDExtension bindings for Rust).

The [godot-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/) library is a pure Rust implementation of the GDExtension bindings. This means you can write code in Rust that's equivalent to what you'd typically use GDScript or C# for in Godot.

A key advantage is that because your game project is fundamentally a Rust project, you can easily integrate other Rust tools and libraries. For example, you can incorporate [Bevy Engine](https://bevy.org/) packages, or use [Vulkano](https://crates.io/crates/vulkano) and [Ash](https://crates.io/crates/ash) for Vulkan graphics code. We're planning future templates that will include pre-built scripts for common features, incorporating Bevy ECS templates, among others.

## Where to Find Help?

If you encounter problems or have suggestions for the CLI itself, including ideas for new templates, changes, or bug fixes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/viniciusmorgado/godust). Feel free to submit pull requests (PRs) for any changes or improvements you'd like to contribute.

However, if you need assistance with programming your game using Godot and Rust, here are some excellent resources:

- **godot-rust Official Book**: The [official book](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/index.html) is your primary guide for learning Godot with Rust.
- **godot-rust API Documentation**: For detailed information on the available functions and modules, consult the [API documentation](https://godot-rust.github.io/docs/).
- **godot-rust GitHub**: If you encounter bugs specifically related to godot-rust, you can check their [GitHub repository here](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdext).
- **godot-rust Demo Projects**: Remember that godot-rust also maintains its own repository of [demo projects](https://github.com/godot-rust/demo-projects). While our templates don't strictly adhere to these examples (we aim for more dynamic generation), you can still extract useful content and insights from them.
- **Community Communication Channels**: For further community engagement for godot-rust, you can find links to communication groups like Discord and Mastodon on the [godot-rust main website](https://godot-rust.github.io/).

- **Godot Engine Official Documentation**: You will likely also want to consult the [Godot Engine official documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/). It's arguably the best source for understanding the engine's core concepts and inner workings. If you're learning, adapting the GDScript and C# samples and tutorials to Rust can be an extremely helpful exercise.

**Disclaimer**: Please note that this CLI and its templates are an independent project and are not associated with godot-rust or its development team.

# Templates Roadmap

## Basic Templates

| Template | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Blank** | âœ… | Godot-rust and Godot setup ready to use. Default template when no template is selected. Provides minimal project structure to start building. |
| **Blank + Bevy ECS** | ðŸš§ | Blank template integrated with Bevy's Entity Component System for enhanced game logic architecture and performance. |
| **Basic Hello World** | ðŸ“‹ | Simple "Hello World" example demonstrating basic Godot-rust usage and core concepts. |
| **Basic 3D Hello World** | ðŸ“‹ | 3D scene with basic interaction example. Introduces 3D nodes, transforms, and spatial scripting. |
| **Basic 2D Hello World** | ðŸ“‹ | 2D scene with basic interaction example. Covers 2D nodes, sprites, and basic game mechanics. |

## Full Templates

| Template | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Third Person** | ðŸ“‹ | Complete third-person character controller with camera, movement, and interaction systems. |
| **First Person** | ðŸ“‹ | Complete first-person character controller with mouse look, WASD movement, and basic mechanics. |
| **Top Down** | ðŸ“‹ | Full top-down game template with camera, movement, and common gameplay patterns. |
| **Vehicle** | ðŸ“‹ | Complete vehicle physics and controls template with driving mechanics and camera systems. |

**Status Legend:**
- âœ… **Complete** - Ready to use
- ðŸš§ **In Progress** - Currently being developed
- ðŸ“‹ **Planned** - Scheduled for future development

## Pre-requisites

Before getting started, please ensure you have the following installed:

* Godot Engine and its command-line interface (Godot CLI) - [To setup Godot CLI click here.](https://github.com/viniciusmorgado/godust/blob/main/assets/setup_cli.md)
* The Rust package manager, Cargo (which comes with a standard Rust installation) - [To install Rust and Cargo click here.](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## How to use it

To generate the template:

Note: For now, we only have the "blank" template available. The `-t` (or `--template`) parameter is optional and defaults to "blank". When new templates are available, you can use this parameter to choose them.

To use the blank template you need to define the engine version, render method and the project name:

```
godust --name my_project_name --engine 4.5 --rendering-method "forward_plus"
```

You can also explicitly specify the template (optional, since it defaults to "blank"):

```
godust --name my_project_name --engine 4.4 --rendering-method "forward_plus" --template blank
```

Or using the short form:

```
godust -n my_project_name -e 4.4 -r "forward_plus" -t blank
```

Godust help:

```
Godust - CLI tool for Godot Engine template generation

Usage: godust --name <NAME> --engine <ENGINE> --rendering-method <RENDERING_METHOD> [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -n, --name <NAME>                          Project name
  -e, --engine <ENGINE>                      Engine version
  -r, --rendering-method <RENDERING_METHOD>  Render method (forward_plus, gl_compatibility, mobile)
  -t, --template <TEMPLATE>                  Template (available: blank) [default: blank]
  -h, --help                                 Print help
  -V, --version                              Print version
```

Everything works well if you see something like this:

```
Successfully created project structure for 'my_project_name'...
Successfully created Rust project 'my_project_name_core'...
Successfully created Godot project 'my_project_name'...
- Godot project name: my_project_name
- Rust project name: my_project_name_core
- Engine version: 4.4
- Rendering method: forward_plus
```
## Running Your Project

After generating your Godot-Rust project, there are a couple of essential steps before you can run it in the Godot editor:

1. **Build the Rust project**: Navigate into the core of your new project where the Cargo.toml file is located. This will typically be at my_project_name/my_project_name_core. Once there, run the following command to build your Rust code:
```
cargo build
```
Note: For a production build you will compile using ``` cargo build --release ```.

This command compiles your Rust code, making it ready for Godot to use.

2. **Open in Godot Engine**: Once the Rust build is complete, you can open and import your Godot project. The Godot project file (project.godot) is located in my_project_name/my_project_name/project.godot. Open the Godot editor and import this project.

Even though the template generation process customizes the name of the core project (the Rust part of the project), which is different from the default defined in the [godot-rust book HelloWorld tutorial](https://godot-rust.github.io/book/intro/hello-world.html), the overall structure still needs to respect the same layout.
